IF NEEDED: To setup the wheel motors (Using a Ubuntu 24.04 laptop, some of this may not work on the ARM architecture)
1. Used Arduino v1.8.19
2. Set additional Boards Manager URLS to:
	http://localhost/OpenCR/arduino/opencr_release/package_opencr_index.json
3. Arduino | Tools | Board | Boards Manager installed OpenCR by Robotis version 1.52. NOTE: Version 1.53 is broken.
4. As per: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/faq/ section 14.3
5. Connected to the OpenCR Board and Arduino | File | Examples | turtlebot3 | turtlebot3_setup | turtlebot3_setup_motor
6. Unplugged Left motor only right motor is plugged in and sent the code to the OpenCR Board, selected option 2, and yes.
7. Unplugged right motor and plugged in left motor and reset the OpenCR board, selected 1 and yes.
8. Plugged in both motors reset the board then tested with options 3 and 4.
9. Step test should pass before going forward.

SETUP OpenCR with ROS2 code running, I followed the below instructions to push the turtlebot3 ROS2 code.
Source: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup/

sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf  
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install libc6:armhf  
export OPENCR_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0  
export OPENCR_MODEL=waffle 
rm -rf ./opencr_update.tar.bz2
wget https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR-Binaries/raw/master/turtlebot3/ROS2/latest/opencr_update.tar.bz2 
tar -xvf opencr_update.tar.bz2
cd ./opencr_update 
./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr

Then tested by holding down SW2 on the OpenCR board for about 3 seconds. Both wheels drove

Missing Dynamixel2Arduino.h
So I did:
https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/Dynamixel2Arduino.git
cd Dynamixel2Arduino/
bash ./install.sh
